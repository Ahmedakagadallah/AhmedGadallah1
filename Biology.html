                        Due to the curricular differences between STEM schools and primary and elementary schools, many students find it challenging to adjust. Therefore, I cooperated with some students at a STEM school and conducted 5+ sessions for the newcomers to assist them learn how to study and which resources to use.
                        In addition, we maintained a close check on them until the final exams; we created a question bank for the curriculum-based biological subjects. The test bank contains the majority of questions and concepts. The test bank covers the majority of the questions and concepts. We worked hard to gather numerous tough questions and ideas from worldwide biology Olympiad questions and AP books, and we even generated some new questions and supplied solutions.
                   <p>Also, we made some summaries for the body systems.</p>
