                            I competed in the ISEF competition in grade 11. My study goal was to help solve a problem certain countries have with energy availability, especially renewable clean energy. I considered employing magnetotactic bacteria to generate power.
                            <p>I used Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction and an appropriate growing medium to raise these bacteria's magnetosome number and size to boost electricity production (diameter). Magnetotactic bacteria (MTB) contain magnetosomes, membrane-covered magnetic ions. Thus, as the bacteria travel through the capillary tube, which lies between the two poles of the electromagnet (solenoid), they create an electric current due to mechanical energy from their movement after being pumped into the tube and monitored by the solenoid. Magnetosomes that react to the external magnet move these bacteria in the capillary tube. </p>

                           <p>Thanks to this project, I was introduced to one of the most effective problems for some countries, which is energy. Also, I was introduced to the technology of software coding and got deep with integrated concepts between mathematics and engineering in making the scientific basics of the project and building the prototype design.
                             I created a calculator to calculate the induced voltage and current using Fraday's law of electromagnetic induction. The loop number of selenoid coils, magnetic flux, and resistance are the inputs.</p>
