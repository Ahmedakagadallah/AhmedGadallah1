                            Through our journey in science, we sometimes stumble across gripping science topics in our fields of interest and find them tremendously exciting to us that we research them from upside down. That is why, today, I am proud to introduce the first youth science journal ever made in Egypt!

                            My team and I hope to build on our magnificent enthusiasm for science by creating a platform that promotes young researchers to delve into topics from various fields of science whilst providing scientific content for readers. By writing advanced yet simplified articles about different sciences from Biology to Physics to Astronomy, we will share our discoveries of the different inventions through the last decade. We aspire to encourage students to research beyond those articles and perhaps pique their interest in a certain field!
                            
                            "Behind every significant initiative comes great responsibility" We have taken responsibility and succeeded in publishing 8 issues containing more than 40 scientific research articles under the supervision of many Egyptian professors. 
                           
                                Now the journal has become an international journal, as it contains research articles written by students from different countries of the world (USA, India, China...).
                            Furthermore, all issues go through extensive reviews and quality checks to make sure our content satisfies our high standards, and you can check that by yourself.

                        We aspire to promote young researchers and writers by walking them through the standard procedures of publishing a scientific article; that is, delivering a manuscript, editing & peer-review, and finally acceptance or rejection. Through our monthly-issues, we hope to bring the hard work of those writers to light while also providing a constant stream of quality, entertaining, and highly scrutinized content for readers hungry for science. These articles, however, are but an initial spark that encourages readers to go beyond and delve more deeply into their topics of interest on their own, advertising independent research and self-learning.
